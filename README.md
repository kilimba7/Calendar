# Calendar

Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a calendar that would inform the user what the current day is, on top of being able to add/save tasks within the calendar. The calendar includes color coordination that syncs up with the current time in order to give the user the most accurate layout. My biggest challenge has been trying to get the info from my localstorage to appear on my website after I refresh. I can see that it's saving to localstorage, but I'm still having issues.
