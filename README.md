# Calendar

##Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a calendar that would inform the person what the current day is and also allow them to be able to edit the tasks within the calendar. My biggest challenges include not being able to get the time in my calendar to match up with the current time. Another one was properly sending my info to my local storage.
